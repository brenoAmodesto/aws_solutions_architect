- Available for containers on...
    - Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
    - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (Amazon EKS)
    - Kubernetes platforms on EC2
    - Fargate (both for ECS and EKS)
- in Amazon EKS and Kubernetes, CloudWatch Insights is using a containerized version of the CloudWatch Agent to discover containers

## CloudWatch Lambda Insights
