# Internet Gateway (IGW)
- Allows resources (e.g., EC2 instances) in a VPC connect to the internet
- It scales horizontally and is highly available and redundant
- Must be created separately from a VPC
- One VPC can only be attached to one IGW and vice versa
- Internet Gateways on their own do not allow internet access...
- Route tables must also be edited!
