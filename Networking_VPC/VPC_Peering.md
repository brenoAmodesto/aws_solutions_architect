## VPC Peering
- Privately connect two VPCs using AWS' network
- Make them behave as if they were in the same network
- Must not have overlapping CIDRs
- VPC Peering connection is NOT transitive ( must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)
- You must update route tables in each VPC's subnets to ensure EC2 instances can communicate with each other

## VPC Peering - Good to know
- You can create VPC Peering connection between VPCS in different AWS accounts/regions
- You can reference a security group in a peered VPC (works cross accounts - same region)
