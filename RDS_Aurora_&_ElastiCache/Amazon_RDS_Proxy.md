## Amazon RDS Proxy
 - Fully managed database proxy for RDS
 - Allows apps to pool and share DB connections established with the data base
 - Improving database efficiency by reducing the stress on database resources (e.g, CPU, RAM) and minimize open connections (and timeouts)
 - Serverless, autoscaling, highly available (multi-AZ)
 - Reduced RDS & Aurora failover time by up 66%
 - Supports RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MS SQL Server) and Aurora (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
 - No code changes required for most apps
 - Enforce IAM Authentication for DB, and securely store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
 - RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible (must be accessed from VPC)
