What's an Auto Scaling Group?
- in real life, the load on your websites and application can change in the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly

- The goal of an autoscaling group (ASG) is to:
    - Scale out (add ec2 instances) to match an increased load
    - Scale in (remove ec2 instances) to match a decreased load
    - Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of ec2 instances running
    - Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
    - Re-create an ec2 instance in case a previous one is terminated (ex: if unhealty)

- ASG are free ( you only pay for the underlying EC2 instances)

- Auto Scaling Group Attributes:
    - A launch template (older "launch configurations" are deprecated)
        - AMI + Instance type
        - EC2 User Data
        - EBS Volumes
        - Security Groups
        - SSH Key Pair
        - IAM Roles for your EC2 Instances
        - Network + Subnets information
        - Load balancer information
    - Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity
    - Scaling Policies

- Auto Scaling - CloudWatch Alarms & Scaling
- It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch Alarms
- Metrics such as Average CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances
- Based on the alarm:
    - We can create scale-out policies (increase the number of instances)
    - We can create scale-in policies (decrease the number of instances)
