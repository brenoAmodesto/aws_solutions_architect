## AWS Outposts
- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongisde a cloud infrastructure

- Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems:
    - One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, CLI and AWS APIs)
    - One for their on-premises infrastructure
- AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud

- AWS will setup and manage "outposts racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging aws services on-premises
- You are responsible for the outposts rack physical security
