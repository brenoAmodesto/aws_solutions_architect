## Routing Policies - IP-based Routing

- Routing is based on clients' IP addresses
- You provide a list of CIDRs for your clients and the corresponding endpoints/locations (user-ip-to-endpoint mappings)
- Use cases: Optimize performance, reduce network costs...
- Example: route end users from a particular ISP to a specific endpoint
