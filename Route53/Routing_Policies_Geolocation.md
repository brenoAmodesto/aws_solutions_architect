## Routing Policies - Geolocation

- Different from Latency-based!
- This routing is based on user location
- Specify location by Continent, Country or by US State (if theree's overlapping, most precise location selected)
- Should create "Default" record (in case there's no match on location)
- Use cases: website localization, restrict content distribution, load balancing,
- Can be associated with Health Checks
