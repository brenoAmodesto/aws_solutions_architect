## Ordering data into Kinesis
- Imagine you have 100 trucks
 (truck_1, truck_2, â€¦ truck_100) on
 the road sending their GPS positions
 regularly into AWS.
- You want to consume the data in order for each truck, so that you can track their movement accurately.
- How should you send that data into Kinesis

- Answer: send_using a "Partition Key"
- The same key will always go to the same shard

# Kinesis vs SQS ordering
- Let's assume 100 trucks, 5 kinesis shards, 1 SQS FIFO
- Kinesis Data Streams:
    - On average you'll have 20 truckers per shard
    - Trucks will have their data ordered within each shard
    - The maximum amount of consumers in paralell we can have is 5
    - Can receive up to 5 MB/s of data
- SQS FIFO  
    - You only have one SQS FIFO queue
    - You will have 100 Group ID
    - You can have up to 100 Consumers (due to the 100 Group ID)
    - You have up to 300 messages per second (or 3000 if using batching)
